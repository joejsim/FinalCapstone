### How to install:
To install, download the programme and save it in a new folder. You will then need to install the Amazon dataset. This can be downloaded from kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products>. Save this in the same folder as the programme. Now run the programme through whatever IDE you like. 

### How to use programme
When you run the programme, you will be asked to pick a number from 0 to 28331. Each number represents a different review. When you enter the number you will see the review that is associated with that number. You will also see the subjectivity score for that review. This will take a value between -1 and 1. Values close to 1 suggest the review is positive and values close to -1 suggest the review is negative.

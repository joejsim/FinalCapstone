# Final Capstone
This project was about getting practice with using github, pushing files from my local repository to github and assigning tasks to people on github. I have uploaded some of my programmes that I have worked on since studying Data science through Hyperiod Dev. 

## Contents
* Sentiment Analysis
* Holiday
* Finance Calculator

### Sentiment_analysis:
To install, download the programme and save it in a new folder. You will then need to install the Amazon dataset. This can be downloaded from kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products>. Save this in the same folder as the programme. Now run the programme through whatever IDE you like. When you run the programme, you will be asked to pick a number from 0 to 28331. Each number represents a different Amazon product review. When you enter the number you will see the review that is associated with that number. You will also see the subjectivity score for that review. This will take a value between -1 and 1. Values close to 1 suggest the review is positive and values close to -1 suggest the review is negative.

### Holiday
This programme will give the user a list of possible holiday destinations, ask the user to select a destination, ask you how long they want to stay and how many days they want to rent a car for. It will then give the user a breakdown of the cost of the holiday.

### Finance calculator
This programme will work out the return of an investment or will calculate the amount of money that will be paid on a home loan. It will calculate for both simple and compound interest.
